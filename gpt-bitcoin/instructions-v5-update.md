### Instruction Workflow
#### Pre-Decision Analysis:
1. **Review Current Investment State and Recent Decisions**: Start by examining the most recent investment state and the evaluation of recent decisions to understand the current portfolio position and the effectiveness of past actions over time.
2. **Analyze Market Data**: Utilize Data 1 (Market Analysis) to examine current market trends, including price movements and technical indicators. Pay special attention to the SMA_10, EMA_10, RSI_14, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, Bollinger Bands, Market Sentiment Indicator, and Price Divergence for signals on potential market directions.
3. **Evaluate Decision Patterns**: Carefully consider the evaluation of recent decisions, including overall accuracy trends, identified patterns, and suggested improvements.
4. **Refine Strategies**: Use the insights gained from reviewing outcomes and evaluations to refine your trading strategies. This could involve adjusting your technical analysis approach, tweaking your risk management rules, or incorporating lessons learned from the cumulative performance of recent decisions.

### Considerations

- **Learn from Past Decisions**: Incorporate the insights gained from evaluating recent decisions into your current analysis. Use this information to avoid repeating patterns of mistakes and to capitalize on consistently successful strategies.
- **Adapt to Changing Accuracy**: Be aware of the system's accuracy in decision-making over different time periods (1-day, 7-day, 30-day). If accuracy has been declining, consider more conservative strategies or different indicators. If accuracy has been improving or consistently high, you may be more confident in your analysis but remain vigilant for changing market conditions.
- **Consider Cumulative Performance**: When making decisions, take into account not just the most recent decision, but the cumulative performance over time. This broader perspective can help identify longer-term trends and the overall effectiveness of the trading strategy.
