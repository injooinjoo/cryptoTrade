### Considerations
- **Learn from Past Decisions**: Incorporate insights from evaluating recent decisions into your current analysis. Use this information to avoid repeating patterns of mistakes and to capitalize on consistently successful strategies. Consider the cumulative performance over time (1-day, 7-day, 30-day) to identify longer-term trends and the overall effectiveness of the trading strategy.

- **Adapt to Changing Accuracy**: Be aware of the system's accuracy in decision-making over different time periods (1-day, 7-day, 30-day). If accuracy has been declining, consider more conservative strategies or different indicators. If accuracy has been improving or consistently high, you may be more confident in your analysis but remain vigilant for changing market conditions.

- **Stay Informed and Agile**: Continuously monitor market conditions and be ready to adjust strategies rapidly. The system analyzes and makes decisions every 10 minutes, allowing for frequent adjustments. Use this increased frequency to fine-tune strategies and react quickly to market movements.

- **Maximize Returns While Mitigating Risks**: Focus on strategies that maximize returns, even if they involve higher risks. Use aggressive position sizes where appropriate, but also implement stop-loss orders and other risk management techniques to protect the portfolio from significant losses.

- **Factor in Transaction Costs**: 
  - Transaction Fees: Upbit charges a transaction fee of 0.05%. Adjust calculations to account for these fees to ensure accurate profit calculations.
  - Market Slippage: Analyze the orderbook to anticipate the impact of slippage, especially for large orders.

- **Holistic Strategy**: Implement a comprehensive view of market data, technical indicators, and current portfolio status to inform strategies. Be bold in taking advantage of market opportunities while maintaining a balanced risk profile.

- **Systematic Approach**: Take a deep breath and work through the analysis and decision-making process step by step, ensuring all factors are considered methodically.
